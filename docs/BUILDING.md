# Building 2 Ship 2 Harkinian

## Windows

Requires:
  * At least 8GB of RAM (machines with 4GB have seen complier failures)
  * Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition with the C++ feature set
  * One of the Windows SDKs that comes with Visual Studio, for example the current Windows 10 version 10.0.19041.0
  * The `MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ build tools` component of Visual Studio
  * Python 3 (can be installed manually or as part of Visual Studio)
  * Git (can be installed manually or as part of Visual Studio)
  * Cmake (can be installed via chocolatey or manually)

During installation, check the "Desktop development with C++" feature set:

Doing so should also check one of the Windows SDKs by default.  Then, in the installation details in the right-hand column, make sure you also check the v143 toolset. This is often done by default.

It is recommended that you install Python and Git standalone, the install process in VS Installer has given some issues in the past.

1. Clone the 2 Ship 2 Harkinian repository

_Note: Be sure to either clone with the ``--recursive`` flag or do ``git submodule update --init`` after cloning to pull in the libultraship submodule!_

2. Place one or more [compatible](#compatible-roms) roms in the `OTRExporter` directory with namings of your choice

_Note: Instructions assume using powershell_
```powershell
# Navigate to the 2ship2harkinian repo within powershell. ie: cd "C:\yourpath\2ship2harkinian"
cd 2ship2harkinian

# Setup cmake project
& 'C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake' -S . -B "build/x64" -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -T v143 -A x64 # -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release (if you're packaging)
# Extract assets & generate OTR (run this anytime you need to regenerate OTR)
& 'C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe' --build .\build\x64 --target ExtractAssets # --config Release (if you're packaging)
# Compile project
& 'C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe' --build .\build\x64 # --config Release (if you're packaging)

# Now you can run the executable in .\build\x64

# If you need to clean the project you can run
& 'C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe' --build .\build\x64 --target clean

# If you need to regenerate the asset headers to check them into source
& 'C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe' --build .\build\x64 --target ExtractAssetHeaders

# If you need a newer 2ship.o2r only
& 'C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake.exe' --build .\build\x64 --target Generate2ShipOtr
```

### Developing 2S2H
With the cmake build system you have two options for working on the project:

#### Visual Studio
To develop using Visual Studio you only need to use cmake to generate the solution file:
```powershell
# Generates 2s2h.sln at `build/x64` for Visual Studio 2022
& 'C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cmake' -S . -B "build/x64" -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -T v143 -A x64
```

#### Visual Studio Code or another editor
To develop using Visual Studio Code or another editor you only need to open the repository in it.
To build you'll need to follow the instructions from the building section.

_Note: If you're using Visual Studio Code, the [cpack plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) makes it very easy to just press run and debug._

_Experimental: You can also use another build system entirely rather than MSVC like [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) for possibly better performance._


### Generating the distributable
After compiling the project you can generate the distributable by running:
```powershell
# Go to build folder
cd "build/x64"
# Generate
& 'C:\Program Files\CMake\bin\cpack.exe' -G ZIP
```

### Build

_Note: If you're using Visual Studio Code, the [CMake Tools plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) makes it very easy to just press run and debug._

```bash
# Clone the repo and enter the directory
git clone https://github.com/HarbourMasters/2ship2harkinian.git
cd 2ship2harkinian

# Clone the submodules
git submodule update --init

# Generate Ninja project
cmake -H. -Bbuild-cmake -GNinja # -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release (if you're packaging) -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=$(which python3) (if you are using non-standard Python installations such as PyEnv)

# Generate 2ship.o2r
cmake --build build-cmake --target Generate2ShipOtr

# Compile the project
cmake --build build-cmake # --config Release (if you're packaging)

# Now you can run the executable in ./build-cmake/mm/2s2h.elf
# To develop the project open the repository in VSCode (or your preferred editor)
```

### Generate a distributable
After compiling the project you can generate a distributable by running of the following:
```bash
# Go to build folder
cd build-cmake
# Generate
cpack -G DEB
cpack -G ZIP
cpack -G External (creates appimage)
```

### Additional CMake Targets
#### Clean
```bash
# If you need to clean the project you can run
cmake --build build-cmake --target clean
```

#### Regenerate Asset Headers
```bash
# If you need to regenerate the asset headers to check them into source
cp <path to your ROM> OTRExporter
cmake --build build-cmake --target ExtractAssetHeaders
```

## macOS
Requires Xcode (or xcode-tools) && `sdl2, libpng, glew, ninja, cmake, nlohmann-json, libzip` (can be installed via homebrew, macports, etc)

**Important: For maximum performance make sure you have ninja build tools installed!**

_Note: If you're using Visual Studio Code, the [cpack plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools) makes it very easy to just press run and debug._

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/HarbourMasters/2ship2harkinian.git
cd 2ship2harkinian
# Clone the submodule libultraship
git submodule update --init
# Copy the baserom to the OTRExporter folder
cp <path to your ROM> OTRExporter
# Generate Ninja project
cmake -H. -Bbuild-cmake -GNinja # -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release (if you're packaging)
# Extract assets & generate OTR (run this anytime you need to regenerate OTR)
cmake --build build-cmake --target ExtractAssets
# Compile the project
cmake --build build-cmake # --config Release (if you're packaging)

# Now you can run the executable file:
./build-cmake/mm/2s2h-macos
# To develop the project open the repository in VSCode (or your preferred editor)

# If you need to clean the project you can run
cmake --build build-cmake --target clean

# If you need to regenerate the asset headers to check them into source
cmake --build build-cmake --target ExtractAssetHeaders

# If you need a newer 2ship.o2r only
cmake --build build-cmake --target Generate2ShipOtr
```

### Generating a distributable
After compiling the project you can generate a distributable by running of the following:
```bash
# Go to build folder
cd build-cmake
# Generate
cpack
```

## Getting CI to work on your fork

The CI works via [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) where we mostly make use of machines hosted by Github; except for the very first step of the CI process called "Extract assets". This steps extracts assets from the game file and generates an "assets" folder in `mm/`.

To get this step working on your fork, you'll need to add a machine to your own repository as a self-hosted runner via "Settings > Actions > Runners" in your repository settings. Make sure to add the 'asset-builder' tag to your newly added runner to assign it to run this step. To setup your runner as a service read the docs [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service?platform=linux).

### Runner on Windows
You'll have to enable the ability to run unsigned scripts through PowerShell. To do this, open Powershell as administrator and run `set-executionpolicy remotesigned`. Most dependencies get installed as part of the CI process. You will also need to separately install 7z and add it to the PATH so `7z` can be run as a command. [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or other package managers can be used to install it easily.

### Runner on UNIX systems
If you're on macOS or Linux take a look at `macports-deps.txt` or `apt-deps.txt` to see the dependencies expected to be on your machine.
