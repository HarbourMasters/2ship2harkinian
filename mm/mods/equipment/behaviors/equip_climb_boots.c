/**
 * equip_climb_boots.c - Climb Boots (Extended Boots Slot 2)
 *
 * Takes over the slot the Pendant of Memories used to squat on. The Pendant is NOT gone: it lives
 * on the equipment page's left column (ownership = the adult trade wheel, TRADE_ADULT_PENDANT) and
 * its moveset is dispatched cheat-independently, so this slot is free for a real pair of boots.
 *
 * BEHAVIOR: full traction. While equipped, Link grips every floor —
 *   - ice (FLOOR_TYPE_5) stops skating: same exemption the Iron Boots get, so he walks normally;
 *   - steep slopes (FLOOR_EFFECT_1) neither force Player_Action_SlideOnSlope nor slow the climb.
 * The behavior is all gates in z_player.c keyed on ClimbBoots_HasGrip(); nothing runs per frame.
 *
 * Included by ext_equip_behavior.c (unity build).
