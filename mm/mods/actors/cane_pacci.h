/**
 * cane_pacci.h — Pacci side of the Dual Cane (Skijer's NEI).
 *
 *   FLIP      Launches the aimed enemy straight up, rolls it onto its back and
 *             drops it. Two vanilla behaviours ported wholesale, without touching
 *             either actor: the flip itself is EnTite_SetupFlipOnBack /
 *             EnTite_FlipOnBack / EnTite_FlipUpright (a hammered Tektite), and the
 *             fall is ObjTsubo_Thrown (a thrown pot) — tumbling, with a live AT+OC
 *             collider the whole way down, so whatever it lands on breaks exactly
 *             as if a pot had hit it. It lies paralysed for PACCI_FLIP_ON_BACK_TIMER
 *             frames — no AI at all, so a Deku Scrub cannot duck away and an
 *             Octorok cannot submerge — then hops back upright and resumes.
 *             The effect OUTLIVES the cane: unequipping does not undo it, because
 *             the point is to flip an enemy and then hit it with a weapon.
 *
 *   STONE     Drains the enemy's colour to grey, deletes its AI outright, and
 *             gives it En_Ishi's behaviour: liftable, throwable, and it shatters
 *             into rock debris + dust with NA_SE_EV_ROCK_BROKEN and a random
 *             collectible drop. The enemy is gone for good once it breaks.
 *
 *   ULTRAHAND Grabs whatever you are aiming at and holds it out in front of you,
 *             and welds pieces together into one solid. C enters the mode; from
 *             there A grabs, welds the offered joint, or drops, and only B leaves.
 *
 *               D-pad alone            push / pull
 *               L + D-pad              rotate (left/right = yaw, up/down = pitch)
 *               R + D-pad              raise / lower and slide left / right
 *               Z                      reset orientation to the grab pose
 *               shake the stick L-R    detach
 *
 *             What is drawn while holding, and nothing else: the actor's own colour
 *             filter as the tint, ONE thin tether pass from Link's hand, a real point
 *             light on the object (Pacci_UhLightAt - the only thing here that makes the
 *             model itself green rather than painting over it), and a Maya-style gizmo
 *             of SOLID arrows and rings that appears only while the control it
 *             describes is held. Link keeps his right arm out toward the object.
 *
 *             No shells, no wireframe boxes, no swept tubes. Everything box-shaped drawn
 *             over an actor was a cube scaled to a bounding box, and almost nothing in
 *             this game is a cube - on a gravestone it read as a green slab floating
 *             through the scenery.
 *
 * Only ACTORCAT_ENEMY actors can be flipped or petrified, and never bosses (see
 * Pacci_IsValidEnemy). Ultrahand is deliberately broader: it takes anything the
 * shared target selector considers a loose object.
