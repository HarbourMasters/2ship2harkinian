/**
 * timestop_helper.h - Shared world-time arbiter (Skijer's NEI)
 *
 * One owner of the world clock. Champion's Tunic (slow-motion), Zonai Permafrost
 * (hard stop) and the Phantom Hourglass (rewind scrub) all want to alter how fast
 * the world runs; without an arbiter the one that finishes FIRST restores the
 * world to 1.0f and silently breaks the one still running.
 *
 * Requests are prioritized by owner id (higher wins). Releasing a lower-priority
 * owner never disturbs a higher-priority one that is still active.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — this module only ever touches MOTION and the day/night clock.
 * It never reads or writes health, magic, rupees, actor damage state, scene
 * flags or save data. Damage dealt while time is stopped therefore persists,
 * by construction.
 *
 * MM backend: gChampionSlowFactor (read by z_actor.c Actor_UpdatePos) + R_TIME_SPEED.
