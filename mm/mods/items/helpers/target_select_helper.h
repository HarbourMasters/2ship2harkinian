/**
 * target_select_helper.h - Shared "look at it to pick it" remote selector (Skijer's NEI)
 *
 * Extracted from the Switch Hook's Ultrahand-style live selection, which had an
 * identical private copy in each game's z_arms_hook.c. Any item that needs the
 * player to point at a distant actor and act on it reuses this: Switch Hook,
 * Phantom Hourglass, Dominion Rod, Cane of Somaria...
 *
 * The selection rule is intentionally forgiving: among the actors that pass the
 * filter, the winner is the one whose XZ direction from Link best matches the
 * direction Link is FACING. Height is ignored, so you never have to line up a
 * vertical angle — you just look at the thing.
