/**
 * item_zonai_permafrost.c - Zonai Permafrost (time freeze TOGGLE)
 *
 * Controls:
 *   C Button: toggle the time freeze on / off
 *
 * Features:
 *   - Freezes all actors and the day/night cycle the instant you press the button
 *   - No cast animation and no fixed duration: it stays on until you press again
 *     or the magic meter runs dry
 *   - Link moves and fights freely during the effect
 *   - Green Zonai energy runes visual
 *   - Deku Nut style white flash on every toggle, plus an ice-green screen wash
 *     held for as long as the world is stopped
 *
 * The freeze itself is delegated to timestop_helper (TIMECTL_OWNER_PERMAFROST,
 * the HIGHEST priority claim): a hard stop must win over Champion's Tunic bullet
 * time and over the Phantom Hourglass' rewind scrub. The helper re-applies the
 * freeze every frame from CustomItems_Update, so actors that spawn mid-effect are
 * caught too, it keeps frozen enemies hittable, and it restores the day/night
 * clock on release or scene change.
 *
 * Nothing here touches health, rupees or any flag, and it only ever spends its own
 * magic: damage dealt while the world is stopped, purchases made, and scene flags
 * set all persist normally.

// re-triggers while the freeze is held, so they have to be killable in one call
// when the freeze ends — and stopping by Link's own position pointer would take
// his footsteps and everything else he is emitting down with them.

// exactly the way the menu plays it: from gSfxDefaultPos, so it is flat 2D and
// unattenuated. That also puts it out of reach of ZPerm_SfxStopAll, which only
// kills what is ringing at our own position vector.
//
// The release cue is the same chime running DOWN. A sample cannot literally be
// played backwards here: the sfx player walks PCM forwards only, and a true
// reversal would mean shipping a second, mirrored sample as a custom asset.
// What it does honour is a live pitch — it keeps the f32* it was handed and
// dereferences it every audio frame (`* entry->freqScale`, sfx bank processing
// in code_8019AF00.c) — so pointing it at a value we walk downwards bends the
// cue while it is still ringing. On a short rising chime that glide is what the
// ear reads as the sound running backwards.
//
// The walk is ticked from Handle_ZonaiPermafrost, which runs every frame while
// the item is equipped. Ending the freeze by UNEQUIPPING is the one case that
// stops the tick; the cue then simply rings out at its starting pitch.

// Two separate channels, deliberately:
//
//   * The toggle FLASH is the game's own Deku Nut white-out. Writing a negative
//     value into the transition-fade flash register snaps the fade to full alpha
//     and z_fbdemo_fade runs it back down on its own (255 -> 0 over ~11 frames).
//     It is ticked by Play_Update, NOT by this item, so it always finishes even
//     if the freeze is dropped, the item is unequipped or Link is pulled into a
//     cutscene on the very next frame. Exactly what the thrown nut writes in
//     z_en_arrow.c, so it is the same flash, not a lookalike.
//
//   * The HELD tint is envCtx.fillScreen, the channel the Champion's Tunic
//     already uses for its bullet-time wash. That one is plain state: it stays
//     up until somebody clears it, so it is re-written every frame the freeze is
//     held and cleared explicitly on release. That also makes it self-healing —
//     anything that stomps it gets it back on the next frame — and a scene load
//     clears it for free, since Environment_Init zeroes fillScreen.
