/**
 * weapon_upgrades.h - NEI Weapon Upgrades (progressive weapon levels)
 *
 * The four base weapons become progressive randomizer items. Level 1 is the
 * vanilla weapon (tracked by normal equipment/inventory state); the levels above
 * are these upgrade bits:
 *
 *   progressiveKokiriSword:  L1 Kokiri  → L2 Razor   → L3 Gilded
 *   progressiveMasterSword:  L1 Master  → L2 Real Master Sword
 *   progressiveHammer:       L1 Hammer  → L2 Iron Knuckle's Axe
 *   progressiveBGS:          L1 BGS     → L2 Great Fairy's Sword
 *
 * Persistence: Nei_Save()->weaponUpgrades is a u8 bitfield (one bit per upgrade),
 * serialized by the "nei" SaveManager section in mods/nei_save.cpp. The Kokiri
 * chain uses two bits (Razor then Gilded). The level-1 vanilla weapons persist via
 * the normal SaveContext (sword equip flags / ITEM_HAMMER inventory slot).
