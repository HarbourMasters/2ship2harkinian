/**
 * @file sys_slowly.c
 *
 * This file implements a manager for running an asynchronous task on a thread with the lowest priority.
 *
 * The task callback is expected to have up to 2 void* arguments and have a void return. Setting `argCount` will adjust
 * how many args the callback gets called with, but defaults to 2 and using the 2 argument callback.
 *
 * @note: `argCount` must be set manually, as this file implements no way to configure it.
