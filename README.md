If you're having any trouble after reading through this `README`, feel free ask for help in the 2 Ship 2 Harkinian Support text channels. Please keep in mind that we do not condone piracy.

# Quick Start

2Ship does not include any copyrighted assets.  You are required to provide a supported copy of the game.

### 1. Verify your ROM dump
You can verify you have dumped a supported copy of the game by using the compatibility checker at https://2ship.equipment/. If you'd prefer to manually validate your ROM dump, you can cross-reference its `sha1` hash with the hashes [here](docs/supportedHashes.json).

### 2. Download 2 Ship 2 Harkinian from [Releases](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/2Ship2Harkinian/releases)

### 3. Launch the Game!
#### Windows
* Extract the zip
* Launch `2ship.exe`

#### Linux
* Place your supported copy of the game in the same folder as the appimage.
* Execute `2ship.appimage`. You may have to `chmod +x` the appimage via terminal.

#### macOS
* Run `2ship.app`.
* When prompted, select your supported copy of the game.

### 4. Play!

Congratulations, you are now sailing with 2 Ship 2 Harkinian! Have fun!

### Graphics Backends
Currently, there are three rendering APIs supported: DirectX11 (Windows), OpenGL (all platforms), and Metal (macOS). You can change which API to use in the `Settings` menu of the menubar, which requires a restart.  If you're having an issue with crashing, you can change the API in the `2ship2harkinian.json` file by finding the line `"Backend":{`... and changing the `id` value to `3` and set the `Name` to `OpenGL`. `DirectX 11` with id `2` is the default on Windows. `Metal` with id `4` is the default on macOS.

# Custom Assets

Custom assets are packed in `.o2r` or `.otr` files. To use custom assets, place them in the `mods` folder.

If you're interested in creating and/or packing your own custom asset `.o2r`/`.otr` files, check out the following tools:
* [**retro - OTR and O2R generator**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters64/retro)
* [**fast64 - Blender plugin (Note that MM is not fully supported at this time)**](https://github.com/HarbourMasters/fast64)
